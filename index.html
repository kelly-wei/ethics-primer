                <p>This site will guide you with considerations and questions on how to 
                    approach everyday technical applications with the element of ethical 
                    understanding. It will focus on the popular social media application, 
                    Tik Tok.

                    <h2>About TikTok</h2>

                    <h4>History of TikTok</h4>

                    <p>TikTok was launched in 2016 and is the leading destination for short-form 
                        mobile videos with over one billion active users across over 150 countries. 
                        Content is aimed to inspire creativity, bring joy, and cultivate a sense of 
                        community on the platform. Users are able to create and upload short videos 
                        with a wide range of editing options. They are also able to leverage effects 
                        and filters. Finally, users are also able to follow content that they like 
                        and view content in two different frames: the For You Page and the Following Page. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The For You Page is algorithmic-generated content based on previous interactions on 
                        the app. This is done using calculations on time spent viewing a video, the number of 
                        interactions with the video (i.e. sharing it with friends either on the app or on a 
                        different platform, commenting under a post, liking, or favoriting and saving it to 
                        watch it again at a later time), and time spent on visiting the creatorâ€™s page before 
                        following. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Following Page will show you all posted content in a scrollable feed style from 
                        creators the user chooses to follow. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Content on the app is diverse and ranges from cooking to performances and artistic outlets, 
                        education, beauty, sports, entertainment, and more. And some creators with enough following 
                        and engagement are able to join the TikTok Creator Fund which supports and rewards creators 
                        for their contributions to the platform. While the app is free, creators must meet a minimum 
                        following threshold, accrue the minimum amount of authentic views in the last 30 days, post 
                        original content in accordance with its Community Guidelines, and meet a specific age requirement. 
                        After applying and receiving acceptance into the Creator Fund, monetary compensation is calculated 
                        based on video views and video engagement.
